# Mi-V-Firmware
Mi-V-Firmware are the software components that would help you develop applications targeting the Mi-V soft processor.
- RISC-V HAL        - Hardware abstraction layer for Mi-V soft processors
- Software drivers - Software drivers for [Microsemi IP Cores](http://soc.microsemi.com/products/ip/search/results.aspx?n=&kw=&pf=491%3bproduct%3aDirectCores&fn=none&pv=none&mk=none&ev=0&rd=0&evt=0)

These firmware components and corresponding example applications can be downloaded using the **Firmware Catalog**.

The Firmware Catalog is a standalone executable program that supports Microsemi SoftConsole toolchain targeting the Mi-V processors. 
The Firmware Catalog streamlines locating and generating firmware that is compatible with Intellectual Property (IP) cores used in Microsemi FPGA designs. Firmware can also be delivered through SmartDesign within the Libero environment.

For more details of all the processors and toolchains supported by Firmware catalog refer: [Firmware catalog](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-tools/4880-firmware-catalog#overview)

Below is the view of Firmware catalog user interface.
